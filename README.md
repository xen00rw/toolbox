# Toolbox

A collection of *almost useless* web tools designed to solve problems you didn't know you had. Because sometimes you need to do something trivial in the most overcomplicated way possible.

## Tools

- **Content Type Converter** - Do you need to convert between different content types? Probably not. But now you can!
- **JSON Pretty Printer** - Make your JSON look pretty. As if that matters when your code is still broken.

## How to Use

Visit [Toolbox Home](https://toolbox.xen00rw.me) to access these groundbreaking tools that will surely change your life... or at least waste 5 minutes of it.

## Disclaimer

These tools are meant to be simple, and somewhat pointless. Side effects may include false sense of productivity.
